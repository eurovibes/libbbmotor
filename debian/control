Description: Seeed BeagleBone motor bride cape access library
 The Motor Bridge Cape features bi-directional motor control using two
 TB6612FNG integrated dual H-bridge, so it can control two stepper motors or
 four brushed DC motors with 6~15V DC power and about 1A current draw per
 motor. The cape provides 5V regulated power to SeeedStudio BeagleBone Green
 or BeagleBone Black with a max input voltage of 15V. It also has six servo
 control interface and six expand IO. All the features are provided by the on
 board STM32F0 coprocessor. The coprocessor can communicate with BeagleBone
 by I2C or UART interface.
 .
 libbbmotor provides a C API for a convenient access and handling.
